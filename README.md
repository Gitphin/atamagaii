A task managing app and much more

## PREMISE:
As you may be well aware there are plenty of "to-do" apps already out there that accomplish pretty much the same thing. This is not what this project aims to be, at least not in your stereotypical way.

### Weekly view formatting:
- Many of these to-do apps do not focus on having a weekly layout. For example, I have my tasks structured from Monday to Sunday, rather than in just one big list. I hope to implement this as well as keeping the other option available for users.
- Within the weekly layout, reoccuring tasks (like in a calendar) will be available, with the option to turn these on and off
- Cross-off then delete items, basically what you can find in any other to-do app
- Drag & Drop support for these items, with the ability to move them around at will.
- Custom color formatting for tasks will be available

### User/Group task managing system:
- Completing tasks allows user's to gain points.
- I want users to be able to collaborate together or share each other's progress. This may look like creating a group together, a way to send tasks & memos to each other, sharing progress, and much more.
- Forming parties together will allow users to work together towards goals and get points. I am hoping to add some sort of streak or reward system for this, which can be set up by the party.
### Progress tracking layout
- Adding on to what was mentioned earlier, I will be adding a progress bar for categories of tasks
- Ability to group tasks based on categories, which will act as kind of a tag for an assignment
- Can input how much time it takes on a certain task, therefore if correctly inputted will calculate how much time spent that week
### Daily random task assignment
- Have a random task that you can complete every day (that you assign), kind of like spinning a wheel
- Be able to get points/xp when you complete the task, used for something later down the road?
### And more!
- Will be continuing to brainstorm ideas for this app
